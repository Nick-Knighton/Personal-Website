        "The Rev's American Grill website project involved a team of five, with me as the lead front-end designer. Collaborating with my talented colleagues, we utilized React and Django to create an appealing and user-friendly website. I took charge of designing the layout, integrating various Google APIs for enhanced functionality, and ensuring seamless connectivity between all elements. Leveraging GitHub for version control and MySQL for storing menu items and inventory, we successfully delivered a dynamic website that allowed customers to explore the menu, servers to input orders, and managers to check stock levels.",

      description:
        "The grocery list and recipe storage project was completed as part of an Angular training course on Udemy. Using Angular, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and Firebase, I developed a user-friendly application that allowed users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their grocery lists and recipes. The application provided functionality for adding, editing, and removing items from the grocery list, as well as storing and organizing recipes. With Firebase as the backend service, the application ensured secure data storage and synchronization across devices. The responsive design implemented with Bootstrap enabled a seamless user experience. Overall, the project showcased my proficiency in Angular, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and Firebase, delivering a convenient and organized solution for managing grocery lists and storing recipes.",

      description:
        "During my internship at RBFCU, I undertook a web development project to update their Non-member loan application page. Using Angular, TypeScript, and GitHub, I successfully migrated the page from outdated technology to the modern Angular framework. In addition to the technical update, I also revamped the page's style to align it with RBFCU's current style guide. The project not only improved the user experience by leveraging Angular's robust features but also ensured a cohesive visual identity by adhering to the organization's style guidelines. Through this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in Angular, TypeScript, and attention to design details, contributing to RBFCU's ongoing commitment to providing an enhanced digital experience for their customers.",

        "The rasterizer project I completed for my computer graphics class was an impressive undertaking in C++. This program showcased my understanding of rendering techniques as it successfully read in .obj files and computed the coloring for each point. With a focus on versatility, the rasterizer incorporated multiple coloring techniques, allowing for a range of visual effects. By leveraging the power of C++ and implementing efficient algorithms, the program accurately determined the color values for each point, resulting in visually appealing and realistic renderings. Through this project, I not only demonstrated my proficiency in computer graphics but also showcased my ability to apply advanced concepts to create a sophisticated rendering system.",

      description:
        "In my project, I developed a ray tracer using C++, which showcased my expertise in computer graphics and ray tracing algorithms. The ray tracer was designed to simulate the behavior of light in a virtual scene. By calculating rays emanating from the camera, it determined the color and shading of objects in the scene, taking into account multiple light sources, multiple objects, and shadows. The ray tracer's implementation involved efficient algorithms that accurately simulated the interaction of light with different surfaces, resulting in realistic and visually stunning renderings. This project exemplified my ability to apply complex principles in computer graphics and demonstrated my proficiency in C++ programming.",
